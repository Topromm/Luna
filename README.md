## DISCLAIMER: This project is outdated.
This project relies heavily on the discord.py library, which has seen significant changes in recent years. Consequently, the code may no longer function as intended due to updates in the Discord API, discord.py, and other dependencies. If you plan to use or modify this project, I recommend you review and update the code accordingly.

# Luna

Luna is a utility &amp; entertainment tool developed for the Discord platform to help schools, teams and communities manage their servers. 
Whenever you see a ROLE1, CHANNEL1, MEMBER1 or other markings in the code, it's a placeholder that you'll want to replace with your own info.

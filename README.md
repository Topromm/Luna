Lunabot offers some of the most advanced tools &amp; features on the Discord platform, including utility &amp; server management tools and fun user commands. Whenever you see a ROLE1, CHANNEL1, MEMBER1 or other markings in the code, it's a placeholder that you'll want to replace with a role, channel or member ID in your own code.

# Luna

Luna is a utility &amp; entertainment tool developed for the Discord platform to help schools, teams and communities manage their servers. 
Whenever you see a ROLE1, CHANNEL1, MEMBER1 or other markings in the code, it's a placeholder that you'll want to replace with your own info. 

## Features
- [Cogs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html) for easier code updating and separation.
- Admin commands to remotely shut down the bot or the host machine if need be.
- Reaction roles: Assigns roles based on chosen reaction emojis.
- Welcome messages and bot prevention (restricts accounts made within the last 24 hours from joining).
- Error handler: Notifies users of errors while executing commands.
- Logging: Tracks deleted and edited user content, as well as direct messages sent to the bot.
- Latest removed and edited message "sniping" for both normal users and chosen special roles.
- Wide range of utility commands: Add roles, create lists of all members, and more.
- Announcement & messaging tools: Send direct messages, server messages, and create or edit embeds.
